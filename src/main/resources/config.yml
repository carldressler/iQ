# This is the iQ configuration file. Settings you make here personalize your experience with iQ.
# You should keep these things in mind when filling out this file:
#   - NEVER use tabs â†¹, ONLY spaces
#   - If you want to use a colon in a text you have to surround it with quotation marks

# If the configuration is incorrect, you will be informed about it in the console as well as in the ingame chat.
# In case the configuration is incorrect, the standard values for the corrupt entry/entries will be used.

# Tip: To reproduce the symbolic "[iQ]", just write it in the strings using color code &7 for the brackets and the following:
#   - success: &a for the "iQ"
#   - warning or hint: &e for the "iQ"
#   - error: &c for the "iQ"


# If you want to use military time (00:00 - 23:59), set "24h". If you want to use the 12 hour format set "12h".
# Valid values: 12h, 24h | Standard: 24h
time-format: 12h
